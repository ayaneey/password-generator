# JavaScript: Password Generator

## Task

I had to create a password generator that can generate random passwords which include a mixture of lowercase, uppercase, symbols and numbers. Users are able to carefully select which mix they would like which then generate a password that meets their needs. Below you will see a snapshot of the finalized app:
