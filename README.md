# JavaScript: Password Generator

## Task

I had to create a password generator that can generate random passwords which include a mixture of lowercase, uppercase, symbols and numbers. Users are able to carefully select which mix they would like which then generate a password that meets their needs. Below you will see a snapshot of the finalized app:

## What I learned ðŸ“–:

- Understood basic JavaScript syntax and control structures like loops and conditional statements.
- Was able to grasp JavaScript functions and event handling for user interaction.
- Got a better understanding of DOM manipulation to display and update the generated password on the screen.
